## Link to the Visualization Site

## Run the Visualization Locally
To run the visualization, please open Terminal (for Mac) or Command Prompt (for Windows). Navigate to the folder ```474Final/iPhoneCam```. Now run a python command which will create an HTTP web server for this current directory and all of its sub-directories. In the console execute the following command if you're running Python 2.x:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
if you're running Python 3.x or higher, use
```
python -m http.server 8080  (or python3 -m http.server 8080)
```
Now, open your browser and type http://localhost:8080/ in the URL bar and press enter or go. You should now see the visualization.
